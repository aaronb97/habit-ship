This project is using the React compiler; avoid using useCallback and useMemo unless necessary

Do not use the 'any' type

After making all your changes you can run `npm run lint:fix` to fix any auto-fixable linting problems. All linting problems should be fixed before submitting changes

When refactoring prefer to keep external APIs/interface consistent and only change internal implementation unless otherwise specified
